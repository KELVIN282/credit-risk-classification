Overview of the Analysis

This analysis focuses on evaluating machine learning models for predicting loan status. The goal is to determine whether a loan is healthy (0) or high-risk (1) based on financial data.

Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to build and assess machine learning models to predict loan status. By analyzing financial variables such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, and derogatory marks, we aim to classify loans accurately and make data-driven lending decisions.

Data Information

The dataset includes financial details about borrowers, such as:

Loan size: The amount borrowed

Interest rate: The rate applied to the loan

Borrower income: The annual income of the borrower

Debt-to-income ratio: The proportion of income used to pay debt

Number of accounts: Total active credit accounts

Derogatory marks: Negative credit history indicators

Total debt: The borrower's outstanding debt

Loan status (Target Variable): 0 (healthy loan) or 1 (high-risk loan)

Machine Learning Process

Data Preprocessing: Separated features (X) and labels (y), then split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Selection: Used Logistic Regression to classify loan status.

Model Training: Fitted the model using training data.

Performance Evaluation: Assessed accuracy, precision, and recall scores using a confusion matrix and classification report.

Results

Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression

Accuracy Score: [Insert Accuracy Score]

Precision:

Class 0 (Healthy Loans): [Insert Precision Score]

Class 1 (High-Risk Loans): [Insert Precision Score]

Recall:

Class 0 (Healthy Loans): [Insert Recall Score]

Class 1 (High-Risk Loans): [Insert Recall Score]

Summary

Based on the results:

The model performs best when accuracy, precision, and recall scores are balanced.

If recall for high-risk loans (1) is low, the model may not effectively detect risky loans, which is a critical issue.

If precision for high-risk loans (1) is low, the model may incorrectly classify healthy loans as high-risk, leading to missed lending opportunities.

Recommendation

If identifying high-risk loans is the priority, a model with high recall for class 1 is necessary.

If avoiding false positives (misclassifying healthy loans as high-risk) is important, a model with high precision for class 1 is preferred.

Further model tuning, such as using other algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest), may improve prediction accuracy.
